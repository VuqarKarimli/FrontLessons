    <p class="text2">Blockchain is a secure database shared across a network of participants, where up-to-date
        information is
        available to all participants at the same time. Blockchain defined: Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger
        that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can
        be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).
        Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs
        for all involved.
        Why blockchain is important: Business runs on information. The faster itâ€™s received and the more accurate it is,
        the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and
        completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned
        network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And
        because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving
        you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.</p>
