    <p class="text1">NFT means non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are generally created using the same type of
        programming used for
        cryptocurrencies. In simple terms these cryptographic assets are based on blockchain technology. They cannot be
        exchanged or traded equivalently like other cryptographic assets.</p>
    <p class="text2">Like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The term NFT clearly represents it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it
        has unique properties. Physical currency and cryptocurrency are fungible, which means that they can be traded or
        exchanged for one another.</p>
